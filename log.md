**Today's Progress:** Laid out basic idea for calculator app and created some basic functionality e.g. creating numbers to be added

**Thoughts:** Layout was easy enough, hitting a wall on functionality however, can't wrap my head around how to create the calculation to be run

**Today's Progress:** Finished functionality of calculator after rebuild of the logic, also borrowed a design to make it more functional looking, now looking to just polish the functionality slightly

**Thoughts:** Functionality rebuild was easy enough with the use of eval, would still prefer to find a different solution as eval can be messy to use.
